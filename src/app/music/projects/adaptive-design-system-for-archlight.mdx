## Key Features

- **Ambient Soundscapes**: A combination of soft pads, smooth basslines, and atmospheric textures that create a relaxing vibe.
- **Rhythmic Complexity**: Subtle variations in rhythm to keep the listener engaged while maintaining a chill mood.
- **High Production Quality**: Each track was mixed and mastered using industry-standard techniques for optimal sound quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Ableton Live**: For music production and arrangement.
- **Waves Plugins**: For sound design and mastering.
- **Foley Sounds**: Added organic elements by recording foley sounds and integrating them into the tracks.

## Outcome

This project allowed me to experiment with ambient music production while creating tracks that are both calming and inspiring. These chill beats are perfect for working, studying, or just relaxing after a long day.
