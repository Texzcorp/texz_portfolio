## Custom-Built Software for Streamers

*Artemis* is an advanced overlay system built using **Unreal Engine**, providing streamers with fully customized, interactive 3D environments. These overlays are tailored to each streamer’s specific needs, offering real-time reactions to Twitch events such as raids, bits, subs, and chat interactions, while seamlessly integrating with **OBS**.

One of the standout features is the **virtual camera system**, which allows the streamer to interact with the interface privately. The 3D camera moves through a virtual scene, and its feed is directly transmitted to OBS, giving streamers full control of their interface without displaying it to their audience. This ensures a seamless viewing experience while providing enhanced control for the streamer.

## Interactive Alerts with Real-Time Physics

The system enables streamers to offer highly interactive and dynamic alerts. For example, during a raid, an alert can feature a virtual airplane with fully simulated physics that reacts to an explosion mid-flight, resulting in a realistic crash. This physics-based interaction adds a layer of immersion comparable to a video game experience, with viewers able to influence the outcome in real time.

## Real-Time Interaction and Chat Effects

Viewers can directly interact with the stream through chat-driven effects. For instance, the system allows for the **color of the lights** to change in response to colors mentioned in chat messages. This adds a dynamic, real-time element to the experience, allowing viewers to actively participate and shape the visuals. Additionally, flames can grow or shrink depending on the intensity of chat activity, further enhancing viewer engagement and creating a more interactive atmosphere.

## Audio-Reactive Visuals

The **audio-reactive** system responds to both music and the **streamer’s voice**. The lights and effects will adjust dynamically to the **volume and pitch of the voice**, creating a visual experience that syncs with the audio environment. As the sound changes, whether it be the streamer's voice or the intensity of the music, the lights can highlight and adjust their intensity, keeping the visuals in harmony with the stream's audio dynamics.

## Conversion-Driven Features

Artemis is also designed to actively encourage viewer subscriptions and engagement. For example, interactive treasure hunts can be triggered to reward viewer participation, while subs can fill a fuel gauge that, once full, launches a virtual spaceship to a new procedurally generated planet. These features offer viewers incentives to subscribe and engage more actively with the stream, blending interactive content with direct benefits.

## Custom UI and Camera Integration

The system provides fully **custom-built user interfaces**, designed specifically to meet the individual needs of each streamer. These UIs offer personalized features, including **custom keyboard shortcuts** and tailored layouts, allowing streamers to seamlessly control their stream and interact with the environment in a way that fits their unique workflow. This ensures an optimized, streamlined experience, where every control is specifically adapted to the streamer's preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Unreal Engine 4**: The engine that drives the 3D overlays, interactions, and physics.
- **OBS Integration**: The virtual camera feed is transmitted directly into OBS, ensuring real-time streaming without the need for manual screen captures.
- **Twitch API**: Provides real-time interaction between the stream and Twitch events such as raids, bits, subs, and chat activity.

## Challenges and Learnings

Artemis offers a fully interactive 3D environment in real time, providing a unique level of customization and interactivity on Twitch. By seamlessly integrating real-time physics, dynamic overlays, and a virtual camera system, it gives streamers a powerful tool to engage their audience in ways that are still rare on the platform.
