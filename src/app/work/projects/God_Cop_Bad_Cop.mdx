## Overview

God Cop Bad Cop is a strategic deduction game where players assume the role of a deity watching over a city. Your divine mission is to identify a killer among the inhabitants by carefully analyzing their movements and behaviors. Like a celestial detective, you must observe the patterns, use your deductive reasoning, and ultimately strike down the perpetrator with divine judgment.

## Key Features

- **Unique gameplay loop**: Watch the city from a divine perspective, observing all inhabitants' movements and interactions with the ability to stop time and to strike down the killer.
- **Killer Mechanics**: The killer's AI tries to deceive the player by killing only when isolated with a target, ensuring no other NPCs will notice the murder for a while, and sometimes performs actions like fake reporting.
- **Leaderboard**: Players can compare their detective skills with other players.

## Technologies Used

- **Unreal Engine 4**: For building the core game mechanics and top-down perspective
- **Custom AI System**: Powers the inhabitants' behaviors and killer's decision-making
- **Bosca Ceoil**: For music composition
- **SFXR**: For sound design
- **GIMP**: For UI design and animations
 
## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was making the unique gameplay loop intuitive for players. To convey the concept of a god-like detective observing NPCs, we carefully designed visual feedback systems and UI elements that help players understand the killer's patterns. Additionally, we implemented features such as time-stop and an interaction design with saturated colors and distinct head shapes to enhance the game's "twitchability," allowing stream viewers to actively participate in the investigation through chat.

## Outcome

God Cop Bad Cop offers players an immersive, thought-provoking experience that explores the complexities of moral decision-making in law enforcement. The game's branching narrative and dual-role gameplay provide a unique and engaging challenge for players.
