## Overview

In 2020 and 2021, I had the opportunity to join the writing team of **Game of Roles**, working on the expansive and intricate universe of **Aria**. This project was a unique blend of collaborative storytelling, deep character development, and dynamic world-building, where every decision could alter the trajectory of the narrative.

## My Role

As a writer, I was tasked with creating dense and immersive narratives that operated on a logic of **open world** exploration. The world of Aria is vast, with numerous branching storylines, political factions, and complex relationships that gave players the freedom to shape their own path. My role was to ensure that every corner of this world felt alive, full of mystery and potential, while maintaining a coherent overarching plot.

## Writing for an Open World

The challenge of writing for an open world like Aria lay in the need for flexibility. Players were free to explore, make choices, and impact the world around them. This required an approach that balanced **dense narrative content** with the freedom for improvisation. Every storyline had to be meticulously crafted to offer deep lore and meaningful consequences, while still leaving room for player agency.

## Collaboration and Learning

Working closely with **FibreTigre** and the players was an essential part of this process. The collaborative nature of Game of Roles demanded a writing style that was both **reactive** and **proactive**. I had to anticipate the unpredictable nature of player decisions while ensuring the story stayed engaging and coherent. This dynamic pushed me to refine my skills in interactive storytelling and world-building.

## Outcome and Legacy

The seasons I contributed to were met with great enthusiasm by the audience, solidifying **Game of Roles** as one of the most beloved actual plays in France. The dense, open-world writing approach allowed for rich, complex narratives that players could fully immerse themselves in, creating memorable moments that resonated with both players and viewers.

## Reflections

Writing for Game of Roles and the world of Aria taught me invaluable lessons about the art of **collaborative storytelling** and **open-world design**. It was a project that challenged me to think on my feet, adapt to new situations, and embrace the unpredictable nature of live role-playing. It remains one of the most creatively fulfilling experiences of my career.
