## Overview

**Rellik** is an innovative RPG where players take on the roles of assassins tasked with eliminating a high-profile target within a scenario structured into four sequences. The game’s unique design blends traditional RPG elements with modern mechanics, creating a roguelike experience that offers high replayability. Each time the players fail, they restart the sequence but are randomly assigned a new class, leading to a fresh experience every time.

## Gameplay and System

The **Rellik** system is designed to be simple yet engaging, making it accessible for both newcomers and seasoned players. The core mechanics are based on a d10 system, with characters defined by just four core skills:

- **Stealth**
- **Physical & Combat**
- **Social**
- **Perception**

Players start the game with a silenced pistol and a limited number of bullets, and their actions—whether careful or impulsive—are determined by skill rolls that combine different attributes. The game’s sequences are filled with random events and permanent perks that add layers of unpredictability to the adventure.

## Unique Features

- **Random Class Switching**: At each failure, players must restart the sequence with a new, randomly assigned character class. This mechanic ensures that no two runs are the same, adding immense replayability.
  
- **Perks System**: Players can earn perks for their characters by performing exceptional actions. These perks are permanent for the remainder of the session, allowing some characters to become significantly enhanced while others remain less fortunate. The element of randomness in perk acquisition adds a layer of strategy and surprise.

- **Life Hazards**: Each player selects a "cursed number" at the start of the session. Whenever they roll that number on a d10, they draw a "life hazard" card, introducing unforeseen complications into their actions. This mechanic keeps players on their toes, as even the best-laid plans can be disrupted by a twist of fate.

## Replayability

One of the most defining aspects of **Rellik** is its built-in replayability. The structure of the game encourages multiple runs of the same scenario, with new character classes, events, and perks each time. This roguelike approach keeps the experience fresh, challenging, and highly unpredictable. The random elements within the game, from life hazards to class switching, make each attempt feel unique.

## Conclusion

**Rellik** is an exciting blend of traditional RPG mechanics and modern, roguelike elements. Its focus on replayability, randomization, and strategic flexibility offers a fresh take on role-playing games. Whether it's your first time playing or your tenth, the open-world design and evolving challenges ensure that every session is a new adventure.
