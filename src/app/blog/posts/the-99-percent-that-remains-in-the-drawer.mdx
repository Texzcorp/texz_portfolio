## Overview

Over the years, I’ve developed several custom-built tabletop RPG worlds, each with its own unique setting, mechanics, and stories. These universes were designed to offer immersive experiences, combining narrative depth with systems tailored to the needs of the players. Whether it’s exploring geopolitics, the aftermath of war, or the complexities of medieval intrigue, each world offers a distinct role-playing experience.

## The Universes

### L'île aux Oiseaux

Set in the aftermath of World War I, **L'île aux Oiseaux** is a noir-style RPG where players take on the roles of war veterans seeking exile on an island in the middle of the Atlantic. Upon arrival, they find themselves embroiled in a complex geopolitical situation, complete with separatist factions, serial killers, mad scientists, and the cultural consequences of centuries of occupation by different countries. The island’s unique blend of cultures creates a richly textured backdrop for intrigue, survival, and mystery.

- **System**: A custom-built game system that mirrors the moral ambiguity and tension of noir storytelling. Players navigate a web of political intrigue and personal demons while facing the physical and psychological scars of war.

### Tourné vers l'Ouest

**Tourné vers l'Ouest** is a Western-themed RPG designed for both new and experienced players. The system is deliberately simple, making it an ideal entry point for beginners while still providing plenty of excitement and tension for veterans. The world captures the spirit of the Old West, where players can embody gunslingers, outlaws, sheriffs, and settlers in search of fortune, justice, or survival.

- **System**: A straightforward and accessible system that emphasizes fast-paced action and cinematic storytelling, perfect for introducing newcomers to the world of tabletop role-playing.

### Nafdem

**Nafdem** is a richly detailed medieval fantasy world where the lines between good and evil are blurred. Inspired by the political complexities of yakuza films, this universe offers players a morally gray world filled with political intrigue, unique artifacts, and diverse character classes. The simple, accessible system makes it easy for new players to dive into the rich lore and conflicts of the setting.

- **System**: A balanced system designed to be approachable for new players, yet deep enough to support long-term campaigns. It features a wide array of magical artifacts, unique character classes, and a dynamic geopolitical landscape.

## Conclusion

Each of these RPG worlds was built with a custom game system tailored to the needs of its setting, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the narrative while enjoying smooth and intuitive gameplay. Whether delving into the darkness of a post-war island, riding through the Wild West, or navigating the intricate politics of a fantasy kingdom, these worlds offer something unique for every type of player.
