## Overview

Destructex is a Twitch bot project focused on syntactic algorithmics, designed to detect nominal and verbal phrases in chat messages and respond condescendingly. Unlike typical AIs, the bot is based on purely algorithmic logic without relying on deep learning.

## Key Features

- **Syntactic Detection**: Analyzes nominal and verbal phrases to generate appropriate responses.
- **Sarcastic Responses**: The bot is programmed to respond sarcastically and condescendingly.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For implementing the syntax analysis algorithms.
- **Twitch API**: To retrieve real-time messages and send responses.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was creating a robust algorithmic logic capable of processing message syntax in real-time, while avoiding the pitfalls of a traditional deep learning approach. This required a solid understanding of sentence structures and contextual grammar.
