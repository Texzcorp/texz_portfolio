## Overview

This project comes from a cadavre exquis jam, where each team member had one day to modify the project without knowing the final state or what others had done. My role was to compose two music tracks in a single day, influenced by the unpredictable universe of the game.

## Key Features

- **Cadavre Exquis**: Each of the 7 devs/designers/artists had 24 hours to progress without knowing the others' direction.
- **Music**: I composed two musical tracks in one day to accompany this surprising adventure.

## Technologies Used

- **FL Studio**: To quickly compose music under jam conditions.
- **Unity**: For integrating the assets into the game.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main constraint was not knowing what would happen after my part or getting real-time feedback on the other stages, but this also made the process more exciting and challenging.
