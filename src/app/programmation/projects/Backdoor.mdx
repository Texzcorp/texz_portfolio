## Overview

Backdoor is a fast-paced game where you play as a virus trying to delete files from a computer. Face two distinct AI enemies: a mouse cursor that follows predictable movement patterns and an antivirus with various patterns inspired by bullet-hell games.

## Key Features

- **Virus Gameplay**: Control a virus on a computer desktop with the ability to grab files and delete them.
- **Dynamic Challenges**: Evade the user's mouse and avoid detection by the antivirus system.
- **Custom Art and Music**: Retro-inspired visuals and intense chiptune soundtrack that enhances the gameplay intensity

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: For creating the mechanics and custom AI for the antivirus scans and user mouse movement to create dynamic challenges.
- **GIMP**: For designing art and animations.
- **Bosca ceoil**: For music composition
- **SFXR**: For sound design

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was creating distinct and engaging behaviors for each enemy type. The mouse AI needed to feel natural while remaining predictable enough to dodge, while the antivirus required careful balancing between its patrol phases and bullet-hell attacks to maintain challenge without overwhelming players.

## Outcome

Backdoor offers players a unique experience, blending stealth gameplay with the digital world of a computer desktop. The combination of custom art and music creates an engaging and immersive atmosphere, making it a standout entry in the genre.
