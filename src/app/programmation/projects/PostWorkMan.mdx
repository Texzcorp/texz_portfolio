## Overview

Post Work Man is a challenging platformer where players must race across rooftops to return home after work. Using simple controls (WASD/ZQSD to move, Space to jump, Left-click to teleport, and Right-click to cancel teleport), the game offers a unique mix of precise timing and strategy. The teleportation mechanic adds an extra layer of depth, requiring players to master both movement and planning.

## Key Features

- **Teleportation Mechanic**: Master the ability to teleport short distances to traverse tricky platforming sections.
- **Speedrunning Challenges**: Compete against yourself or friends to beat your best completion times.
- **Simple Yet Addictive Gameplay**: Easy-to-learn controls paired with challenging level designs.

## Technologies Used

- **Unreal Engine 4**: For creating the platforming mechanics and overall game design.
- **Custom Teleportation System**: Built to challenge players' reflexes and timing.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing the teleportation mechanic required significant thought to ensure it was both challenging and intuitive. Providing players with adequate control and visual feedback while maintaining a high level of difficulty was a major learning experience. Additionally, a considerable effort was put into the level design's storytelling. Each rooftop and building was meticulously crafted to narrate the lives of the city's inhabitants through environmental storytelling, from clotheslines that reveal family life to workspace setups that depict various professions.

## Outcome

Post Work Man has attracted players interested in challenging platformers and speedrunning, offering a unique and competitive gameplay experience.
